    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the dough</strong>: All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>For the filling</strong>: Ricotta, cream cheese, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley</li>
        <li><strong>For the sauce</strong>: Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and a jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li><strong>For the egg wash</strong>: An egg and water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough</strong>: Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for an hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling</strong>: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong>: Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the ravioli</strong>: Roll out the dough into sheets and brush an egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook and bake the ravioli</strong>: Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well. Bake the ravioli on a greased baking sheet until brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve the ravioli</strong>: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce. </li>
